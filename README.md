# [CourseName]
This repository is meant to reflect the work done by me (mikhaidn) for this Fall 2020 edition of the UIUC course taught by [ChengXiang "Cheng" Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/).

## Course Description

The two main techniques to assist people in consuming, digesting, and making use of the text data
are:
1. Text retrieval, which helps identify the most relevant text data to a particular problem from a large
collection of text documents, thus avoiding processing a large number of non-relevant documents
2. Text mining, which helps users further analyze and digest the found relevant text data and extract
actionable knowledge for finishing a task
This course covers both text retrieval and text mining, so as to provide you with the opportunity to
see the complete spectrum of techniques used in building an intelligent text information system.
Building on two MOOCs covering the same topic and including a course project, this course enables
you to learn the basic concepts, principles, and general techniques in text retrieval and mining, as
well as gain hands-on experience with using software tools to develop interesting text data
applications.
